### Functionality, this app can:
*	Add, delete, complete tasks.
*	Split tasks into categories.
*	Add and delete new categories.
*	Show percentage of done tasks.
*	Save and change user‚Äôs data.

#### Made adaptive layout of application, used JSX and SCSS. In addition, I used LocalStorage to save user and task data.
